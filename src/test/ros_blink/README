THIS WAS A FAILURE. DOESN'T WORK AND CONSUMES NEARLY ALL OF THE UNO'S MEMORY JUST TO BLINK AN LED. DO NO USE.

Test controlling head servo from Arduino.

Note, servo must have a separate power supply, otherwise it jitters considerably and/or causes the Arduino to reset.

Requires these packages:

    sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-rosserial-arduino ros-indigo-rosserial ros-indigo-rosserial-client ros-indigo-angles

In the lib directory, run:

    rosrun rosserial_arduino make_libraries.py .

Based on the ROS Arduino tutorials:

    http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials/Blink

After uploading and running the code on the Arduino, launch two new terminals:

    roscore
    
and:

    rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyACM0
    rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py _port:=/dev/ttyACM0
    
and then to actually blink:

    rostopic pub toggle_led std_msgs/Empty --once
