This is essentially just a glorified voltage divider, providing a 5V signal of the presence of an external 12V charging source.

Since this circuit will be constantly connected during charging, we want to minimize the current wasted so interence with recharging will be at a minimum.

Vin = 12-14V
Vout = 5V

Vout = lambda Vin, R1, R2: Vin * R2/float(R1 + R2)

R2 = 2000000
R1 = 1000000

>>> Vout(Vin=12.6,R1=2000000,R2=1000000)
4.2

>>> Vout(Vin=14,R1=2000000,R2=1000000)
4.666666666666667

Rtotal = R1 + R2 = 3000000
I = V/Rtotal = 12.6/3000000. = .0000042A = 4.2uA
