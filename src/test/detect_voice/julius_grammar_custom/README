Example Grammar for Julius
---------------------------------

In order to use VoxForge's acoustic models with Julius, you have to tell it
what words you want it to recognize and it what context each of those can
be found. You can do this by writting two files, a .grammar and a .term one,
and generating .dfa and .dict files out of those. This file will explain you
briefly how to achieve this.

== QUICK START ==

First, copy the example files to a directory where you can write, like your
home folder, and uncompress the gziped files:

  mkdir ~/julius-grammar
  cp /usr/share/doc/julius-voxforge/examples/* ~/julius-grammar
  cd ~/julius-grammar
  gunzip * 2>&1 | grep -v ignored

Now let's run the following command (available from package "julius"):

  mkdfa sample

This will generate the files "sample.dfa", "sample.dict" and "sample.term" out
of the "sample.grammar" and "sample.voca" files. Once we have those, we can run
Julius with the following command to try the example grammar out:

  julius -input mic -C julian.jconf

Note that only some sentences are recognized, like for example "DIAL ONE TWO"
or "PHONE STEVE". See the next part to learn how to add more words.

In case your recognition rate is near zero, try replacing "mic" in the
command above with "oss", "alsa" or "esd".

== CREATING OUR OWN GRAMMAR ==

Now open up the files "sample.voca" and "sample.grammar" and have a look at
them. The first one defines some categories (lines starting with "%") and lists
some words, together with their phonetic representation. The .grammar file,
which may look a bit more confusing, defines the context in which each word
category can appear.

Feel free to add new words to the existing categories in sample.voca or even
create new ones (adding at least one rule mentioning them to sample.grammar),
but don't forget to write their phonetic representation next to them. You can
get a list of English words and their corresponding phonetic representation
from ftp://svr-ftp.eng.cam.ac.uk/pub/comp.speech/dictionaries/beep.tar.gz.

About the .grammar file, you need to understand that the lines starting with
"S :" are those which define the possible sentences and that they are formed
by one or more category or variables names, between "NS_B " and " NS_E" (which
most be defined in sample.voca and represent the silence at the end and at the
start of the sentence). Variables, like we called them previously, are just
another line in the .grammar file which list a sequence of categories or
other variables, and, as you see in the sample file, they can have many
different definitions.

Once you finish playing with the files, you can generate their equivalents in
Julian's native format again, by running the same command as in the quick start:

  mkdfa sample

Then, run julius as showed above and if everything is right it should recognize
your new vocabulary now. In the case you get an error about missing phonemes,
you'll have to remove the words about which it complains, as the available
acoustic models don't support them.

== PRACTICAL UTILITY ==

As you will probably notice, the VoxForge acoustic model is still far away from
being suitable for dictation applications and the like, so its utility right
now is basically restricted to "command and control" applications. For an
example of how to write a simple one in Python, look at the file command.py
in /usr/share/doc/julius-voxforge/examples/controlapp/.
