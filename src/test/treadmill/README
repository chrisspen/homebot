Proof of concept for driving a robot on a treadmill, attempting to stay a consistent distance from a tracking board directly in front.

We'll be using the main camera to track a pattern, that the robot will attempt to center and keep at a certain size in the frame.

To do this it has to control the speed of two signals, the left and right motors.

We assume the treadmill is always moving.

There will be two PID controllers.

One to adjust orientation, to drift left or right.

One to adjust speed, to speed up or slow down as the treadmill changes.
