Proof of concept for driving a robot on a treadmill, attempting to stay a consistent distance from a tracking board directly in front.

It's assumed that only the three forward facing ultrasonic sensors will be used, not the laser range finder.

PID controller will attempt to keep left and right distances equal, and center sensor at a specific value.

To do this it has to control the speed of two signals, the left and right motors.
