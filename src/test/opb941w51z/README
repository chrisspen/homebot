A test for the wiring for hte OPB941 sensor.

This is very similar in concept to the wiring for the QRD1114.

Build by running:

    make
    make upload
    make monitor

Function:

    When the slotted sensor is obstructed, the signal will read LOW.
    When unobstructed (clear), the signal will read HIGH.
