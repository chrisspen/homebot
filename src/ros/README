This was initialized and built with:

    source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash
    mkdir src
    catkin_make
    
A custom setup.bash was then added to combine ROS's devel/setup.bash with our custom Python virtualenv.

    . ./setup.bash
    echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH

Note, the `overlay` folder stores all the third-party packages that we can't install via `apt-get`.

To add or build a component in the overlay workspace see `build_overlay_ws`.

View camera footage remotely:

    export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://rae.local:11311; rosrun image_view image_view image:=/camera/image _image_transport:=compressed

List running nodes:

    rosnode list

Note, ROS standard log files are located in:

    /home/pi/.ros/log/latest

Graph running nodes:

    rqt_graph

Add to ~/.bash_aliases (including for root user):

    . /usr/local/homebot/.env/bin/activate
    . /usr/local/homebot/src/overlay/devel/setup.bash
    . /usr/local/homebot/src/ros/devel/setup.sh

Logout and then login. You can confirm the correct paths are loaded by running:
    
    rosmsg list|grep -i homebot
    rosmsg list|grep -i rpi

You can test the mjpeg streaming server by viewing it at:

To kill everything:

    sudo supervisorctl stop homebot
    
or for forcifully:
    
    sudo rosnode kill --all

Turn on laser:

    rosservice call /rpi_gpio/set_pin 20 1
    rosservice call /rpi_gpio/set_pin 20 0

View raw image stream:

    export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://rae.local:11311; rosrun image_view image_view image:=/camera/image

To rebuild messages:

    sudo service homebot stop
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade
    rm -Rf build/ros_homebot_msgs
    rm -Rf devel/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ros_homebot_msgs 
    time catkin_make clean
    time catkin_make --pkg ros_homebot_msgs

Sometimes a segfault may occur. In this case, try rebooting and running the above again.

To kill a node:

    rosnode kill <name>

To create a new package:

    catkin_create_pkg <package_name> std_msgs rospy ros_homebot_msgs ros_homebot_python

To run the diagnostic scripts:

    export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://rae.local:11311; rosrun ros_homebot torso_check.py
    
    export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://rae.local:11311; rosrun ros_homebot head_check.py
    
To review all installed all ROS packages:

    rospack list | grep -i packagename
