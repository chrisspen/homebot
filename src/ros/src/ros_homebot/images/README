Note, the QR code contains 5mm of white border.

Note, you must print from Inkscape. Other image viewers will often scale up to cut off the white border, causing the code to print as the wrong size.

./create_qr_code.py "{'domain':'homebot','subdomain':'dock','index':1,'subindex':1,'width_mm':25,'height_mm':25}" homebot_dock_1_1_25x25mm.jpg

    This one was too verbose and tiny, making it difficult to recognize.

./create_qr_code.py "d=homebot,sd=dock,w=25,h=25" homebot_dock_25x25mm_simple.jpg

    Easier to recognize, but still too difficult.
