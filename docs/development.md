These are some miscellaneous notes and conventions about project development.

Creating New Messages and Actions
---------------------------------

Homebot fully supports the ROS concepts of [messages](http://wiki.ros.org/Messages), [services](http://wiki.ros.org/Services) and [actions](http://wiki.ros.org/actionlib).

Each of these is defined by a simple text file. Custom homebot-specific messages and services are defined in the ros_homebot_msgs package.

Many of the messages and services concerning the Arduino boards have been auto-generated by the ros_homebot_python package. The definitions for these are contained in `ros_homebot_python/constants.py`. If you ever add or modify this file, execute it with:

    python constants.py

Additional message and service definitions can be added to ros_homebot_msgs directly. If you do add new definitions, be sure to execute:

    python update_makelists.py

to ensure the ROS makelist contains the most recent list of messages and services to generate. Then, to rebuild all message and service objects, from the `src/ros` directory, run:

    . ./setup.bash
    catkin_make --pkg ros_homebot_msgs

Documentation Server
--------------------

To run the [documentation server](http://www.mkdocs.org/#getting-started) locally:

    mkdocs serve -a :9999

To [deploy documentation](http://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/deploying-your-docs/), run:

    mkdocs gh-deploy --clean
