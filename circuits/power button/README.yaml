    This circuit connects:

    * Adafruit SPST+LED pushbutton
    * Pololu 2808 LV mini pushbutton
    * Arduino
    
    so that:
    
    * the Adafruit pushbutton will trigger the Pololu pushbutton to turn on the Arduino when the system is turned off
    * the Arduino can trigger the Pololu pushbutton to power down the system
    * the Arduino can detect presses of the Adafruit pushbutton for arbitrary uses
    * the Arduino can arbitrarily turn the Adafruit LED on or off
    
    Essentially, this allows the Arduino to mimic the pushbutton power on/power off functionality found in most modern electronics.
