description: |-
    Circuit that accepts an external 12V power supply, and use that to power the onboard Lipo charger simeltaneously with the rest of the robot.
    Includes sensor hookups for monitoring battery voltage as well as the presence of the external power supply.

    In order for the reed switch to properly close, the two magnets in the male plug need to be aligned oppositely.
    
    e.g. If the +V magnet has its north pole facing outwards, then the -V magnet must have its south pole facing outwards.
    
    Outherwise, the two magnets cancel each other out and the reed switch stays open.
    
    EP (external power) goes to an Arduino digital pin.
    
    S1 is a normally-open magnetic reed switch closed by a magnet on the input voltage source plug. I added it because Vin is attached to a battery's positive terminal, so that's there as a safety mechanism to ensure the 8.4V contact doesn't expose live battery leads when the external plug is unplugged.
    
    D1 is necessary so EP stays pulled low when the plug is attached but no external power is present.
    
    AOD4189 is a P-Channel mosfet that disconnects the battery from the load when the external power is present, and connects the battery to the load when the external power is absent.
    
    It's not shown in the schematic, but the battery is implicitly connected to the charger via a 3 wire balance charging cable.
    
    To etch:
    
    1. export for production as svg or pdf
    2. delete all except for files

        Remember, these are going to be flipped when transferred onto copper.

    3. print
    
        for SVG use Inkscape, not Eye-of-Gnome which screws up the scaling
        for PDF, ensure page scaling is set to none
    
    When wiring:
    
        EP = 24 awg
        CHGR PWR = 22 awg
        Load = 22 awg
        Batt = 22 awg
        Sensors = 24 awg
