Note, the Pi-ID IIC pins go to the RPi pins 27/28 (ID_SD/ID_SC), which is the I2C interface for the EEPROM.

The Pi-IIC pins go to the normal I2C pins at RPi pins GPIO2 (SDA) and GPIO3 (SCL).

Note of warning. This shield appears as an I2C device at address 0x68. This shouldn't be a problem in most cases, but make sure any I2C devices you want to use with it aren't hardcoded for that same address. Otherwise they won't work. I stumbled into this problem with an I2C device that also happened to use address 0x68.
