Solarbotics SB-GVS Sensor Shield for Arduino Kit

https://solarbotics.com/product/39230/

Description

You know servos? They have 3-wire connections: Ground / Voltage / Signal. This standard layout has been adopted by many manufacturers for peripherals and sensors. Look specifically at Phidget sensor modules, and practically any hobby-servo on the market.

The SB-GVS shield lets you easily interface this sort of device to your Arduino's 12 digital and 6 analog I/O ports! And it also features a I2C port for peripheral networking (at the sacrifice of 2 analog I/O ports, which share the same pins).

    Ideal for servo & sensor accessories (Phidgets, Seeed Bricks)
    Full break-out for all 12 digital lines & 6 analog lines
    BlinkM-style I2C port
    Power filtering & bypass capacitors
    Pin13 LED indicator
    Reset line brought up from Arduino
    Optional lock-tab sockets available for secure wiring (standard on Phidgets devices, but is still compatible with included 0.1" spaced pin headers)

When looking at possible sensors, look for the interface required. If it says "Interfaces with analog port" or "Interfaces with digital I/O" or similar, you'll most likely be able to interface it to your GVS shield's analog or digital ports.

Note: Some sensors are may be 3.3V compatible only. You must assure they are 5V tolerant to work with this shield!
