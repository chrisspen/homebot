The Raspberry Pi NoIR Camera Module is a custom designed add-on for Raspberry Pi that does not have an 'IR cut filter' installed

Like the regular Pi camera, it attaches to Raspberry Pi by way of one of the two small sockets on the board upper surface.

The sensor itself has a native resolution of 5 megapixel, and has a fixed focus lens onboard. 

In terms of still images, the camera is capable of 2592 x 1944 pixel static images, and also supports 1080p30, 720p60 and 640x480p60/90 video.

This version is best for night-vision use - you'll have to flood the area you're shooting with infrared light. There is some nature photography that is enhanced by an IR camera, as well. It's not great for every-day video and photo taking. In those cases, we suggest the regular Pi Cam. A small piece of blue filter plastic is included in case you want to re-add the cut filter, however it wont look as good as if you had the camera with the original filter in place so it's more for experimentation!
