This tiny breakout board for TI’s DRV8838 motor driver can deliver a continuous 1.7 A (1.8 A peak) to a single brushed DC motor. With an operating voltage range from 0 V to 11 V and built-in protection against reverse-voltage, under-voltage, over-current, and over-temperature, this driver is a great solution for powering a small, low-voltage motor. The carrier board has the form factor of a 10-pin DIP package, which makes it easy to use with standard solderless breadboards and 0.1″ perfboards.
