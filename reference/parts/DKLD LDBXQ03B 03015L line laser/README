Ours are <1mW in a visible wavelength, and are therefore rated as Class II.

    Class II: These lasers cannot cause eye injury under normal circumstances, they can produce injury if viewed directly for extended periods of time. Class 2 lasers only operate in the visible range (400 - 700 nm) and have power output equal or less than 1mW.
