Ultimate I/O Hat for the Raspberry Pi (A+, B+ and Pi-2). Connect your 5V devices to this Raspberry Pi daughtercard.

Features

This card has the following features:

    All GPIO lines are connected to 3.3V GVS connectors
    16 lines of 5V GVS connections
    Hat EEPROM with write enable/protect jumper
    5V Terminal block to power the Raspberry Pi and the I/O Card
    GPIO jumpers to connect up to 16 of the 3.3V GPIO lines to the 3.3V side of the voltage translators

You asked and we listened. We have kickstarted several Raspberry Pi I/O Cards and they have been successful. But some of you wanted more. You liked our configurable channels but asked for more I/O channels and additional power options.

The photo above shows our newest generation card. This Kickstarter takes our previous design and adds another 8 I/O lines plus a terminal block for 5V power. The terminal block allows you to optionally power the GPIO lines and your Pi from an external 5V adapter.
