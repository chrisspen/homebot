Wiring (for a GVS sensor plug):

    Connect green (gnd) and black (cathode) wires together, this will be the common ground.
    
    Add a resistor of 330 in series with red (anode). This limits the current through the IR emitter.
    
    Connect white (vcc) to the anode resistor (red). This will be +5V.
    
    Leave blue (out) as is. This will be signal out, going to a digital pin on the Arduino, configured to use a 20k pullup resistor.
