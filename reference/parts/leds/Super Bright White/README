The unit of measure commonly used to describe LED intensity is the millicandela (mcd), 1000 millicandela equals 1 candela. Candelas measures how much light is produced as measured at the light source.

Direct outside daylight in the summertime averages somewhere in the neighbourhood of 10,000 foot candles. This is equal to 10,000 lumens per square foot.

The sun produces 795775 millicandela, so you'd need about 40 of these LEDs to produce equivalent intensity. Since each LED uses about 20mA, that would consume 0.8A.

    As a frame of reference, a standard 120V/60W light bulb is rated at 850 lm, and the equivalent 230V/60W light bulb is rated at 700 lm. A low voltage (12V) tungsten halogen lamp of 20W gives approximately 310 lm.
