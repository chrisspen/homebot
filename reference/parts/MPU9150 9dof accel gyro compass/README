Product Features

    Digital-output 9-axis MotionFusion data in rotation matrix, quaternion, Euler Angle, or raw data format.
    Tri-Axis angular rate sensor (gyro) with a sensitivity up to 131 LSBs/dps and a full-scale range of ±250, ±500, ±1000, and ±2000dps.
    Tri-Axis accelerometer with a programmable full scale range of ±2g, ±4g, ±8g and ±16g.
    Tri-axis compass with a full scale range of ±1200μT.
    Reduced settling effects and sensor drift by elimination of board-level cross-axis alignment errors between accelerometer, gyroscope, and compass.
