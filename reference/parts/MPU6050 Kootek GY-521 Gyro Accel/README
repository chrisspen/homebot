The pins of the MPU6050 are:

    VCC – Power supply, 3.3 V
    GND – Ground
    SCL – I2C clock
    SDA – I2C data
    XDA – Second I2C bus data
    XCL – Second I2C bus clock
    ADO – Selection of I2C slave address 0x68(=low) 0x69(=high)
    INT – Interrupt pin

    Connect VCC to the 3.3V pin of the Raspberry pi (in case of B+ it’s pin 1)
    Connect GND to the ground pin of the Raspberry pi (in case of B+ it’s pin 6)
    Connect ADO to ground (this means the MPU6050 uses I2C address 0x68)
