Testing found that the 7.4V battery was overcharged to 8.9V, causing the battery to swell.\n\n\nFuture designs should modify the recharge board to include a transistor that allows disconnecting the charger from the battery once the voltage reaches a safe storage voltage of 7.4V. \n\n\nWorkaround: When the robot is connected to external power, the battery should be charged to a safe storage charge of 7.4V and then removed.\n\n\nEffect: serious\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlimited expansion\n\n\nThe overall footprint was kept small (15cm^2) to minimize cost and 3d printing time.\nHowever, even with use of small electronics, like the Arduino and Raspberry Pi, this leaves very little room for expansion and wire routing.\n\n\nFuture designs should double this footprint.\n\n\nThe motors and battery currently selected should still be powerful enough to actuate that size.\n\n\nEffect: average\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfront-panels are difficult to access\n\n\nThe front panels, such as the bumper/edge sensor array, recharging dock, ultrasonic sensor array, and powerbutton, were designed as mainly a single piece, with electronics mounted behind, and then the entire assembly screwed onto the frame. This is difficult to access for maintainence because the panels can't easily be removed without also removing the wire connections to the Arduino. And in order to remove those, the head must be removed.\n\n\nFuture designs should make enough room so wire slack can be added so the panels can be removed, or a socket used so the panel's electrical connections don't need direct wiring.\n\n\nEffect: average\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbattery charger discharges battery when load is off and external power is absent\n\n\nThis is caused by the charger drawing current through the 3-pin balanced charging cable\n\n\nFuture designs should add a diodes to ensure current only goes to the battery, back into the charger.\n\n\nWorkaround: When the robot is turned off and disconnected from external power, the battery should be removed.\n\n\nEffect: average\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntreads lack suspension\n\n\nThe treads ends are too blunt to overcome some sharp obstacles like door thresholds, without subjecting the robot to extensive shock.\n\n\nFuture designs should raise the main idlers up, and include smaller more inset idlers, to allow suspension to dampen shocks.\n\n\nWorkaround: place ballast in the bottom panels\n\n\nEffect: average\n\n\n\n\n\n\njittery head tilt\n\n\nThe servo used to tilt the head up and down has considerable jittery, due to either a poor servo, or inadequate shielding along the servo control cable.\n\n\nEffect: average\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninconsistent head pan reference sensor\n\n\nThe sensor used to mark a centered head position is an IR sensor detecting a white reflective strip. This leads to false positives if there's considerable ambient light.\n\n\nFuture designs should either use IR interruptor switch or hall effect sensor.\n\n\nEffect: minor\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninadequate restraint in head side panels\n\n\nThe two head neck struts are mechanically attached to the center head box via the servo spline on one side and a small clamp on the other. This allows for considerable play between the side head panels and the center head panels, creatign several mm of gap.\n\n\nFuture designs should add small sliding retaining clasps, that attach to the corners of the head box and loop over the edge of the neck struts.\n\n\nEffect: minor",

Future designs should modify the recharge board to include a transistor that allows disconnecting the charger from the battery once the voltage reaches a safe storage voltage of 7.4V.   Workaround: When the robot is connected to external power, the battery should be charged to a safe storage charge of 7.4V and then removed.  Effect: serious    limited expansion  The overall footprint was kept small (15cm^2) to minimize cost and 3d printing time.\nHowever, even with use of small electronics, like the Arduino and Raspberry Pi, this leaves very little room for expansion and wire routing.  Future designs should double this footprint.  The motors and battery currently selected should still be powerful enough to actuate that size.  Effect: average    front-panels are difficult to access  The front panels, such as the bumper/edge sensor array, recharging dock, ultrasonic sensor array, and powerbutton, were designed as mainly a single piece, with electronics mounted behind, and then the entire assembly screwed onto the frame. This is difficult to access for maintainence because the panels can't easily be removed without also removing the wire connections to the Arduino. And in order to remove those, the head must be removed.  Future designs should make enough room so wire slack can be added so the panels can be removed, or a socket used so the panel's electrical connections don't need direct wiring.  Effect: average    battery charger discharges battery when load is off and external power is absent  This is caused by the charger drawing current through the 3-pin balanced charging cable  Future designs should add a diodes to ensure current only goes to the battery, back into the charger.  Workaround: When the robot is turned off and disconnected from external power, the battery should be removed.  Effect: average    treads lack suspension  The treads ends are too blunt to overcome some sharp obstacles like door thresholds, without subjecting the robot to extensive shock.  Future designs should raise the main idlers up, and include smaller more inset idlers, to allow suspension to dampen shocks.  Workaround: place ballast in the bottom panels  Effect: average    jittery head tilt  The servo used to tilt the head up and down has considerable jittery, due to either a poor servo, or inadequate shielding along the servo control cable.  Effect: average    inconsistent head pan reference sensor  The sensor used to mark a centered head position is an IR sensor detecting a white reflective strip. This leads to false positives if there's considerable ambient light.  Future designs should either use IR interruptor switch or hall effect sensor.  Effect: minor    inadequate restraint in head side panels  The two head neck struts are mechanically attached to the center head box via the servo spline on one side and a small clamp on the other. This allows for considerable play between the side head panels and the center head panels, creatign several mm of gap.  Future designs should add small sliding retaining clasps, that attach to the corners of the head box and loop over the edge of the neck struts.  Effect: minor",
